This is a quick and dirty implementation of MGR's bitblit library
for X11 Xlib. It supports 256-color indexed graphics, and fakes
this mode on true-color displays.

It is currently hardcoded to use a 1024x768 window.

Supporting MGR's BITMAP structure is somewhat clunky. MGR assumes a
simple byte array can be used directly as video memory as well as
for off-screen buffers. In X, graphics data must be sent to the X
server and associated with server-resident Pixmaps. Local BITMAP
data must be converted into X format before being usable with the
X graphics operators. This means any bitmap data local to MGR is
always being copied at least once before being usable.

Currently the bit_open()/bit_initscreen() implementation is a bit
broken; the API assumes that multiple processes can call bit_open
and access the same physical screen. The current implementation just
creates a new X window each time it's called, so processes that
expect to see what the MGR server is operating on won't work.

Overall this may not be the ideal way to use MGR; it is nowhere near
as lightweight or responsive as an MGR server with direct hardware
access. But it leverages the extensive video driver work that's been
done for X, using whatever 2D acceleration hardware is available.
